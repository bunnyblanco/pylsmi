On going work to develop my understanding of time series, both stochastic and deterministic.

The original work involved source code I converted from MatLab code for computing the mutual information of a pair of stochastic variables.  Based on work by Suzuki and Sugiyama as a result of a Kaggle competion I entered as a programming assignment for a class.
